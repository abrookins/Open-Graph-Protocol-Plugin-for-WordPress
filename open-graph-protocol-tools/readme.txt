This is a tool to add Open Graph Protocol Data to your WordPress Install.

== Description ==

This is a tool to add [Open Graph Protocol](http://opengraphprotocol.org/) Data to your WordPress Install.

This is very new at this point.

The following data is a description of the metadata that at this point is just a placeholder:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `open-graph-protocol-tools/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
